                    <h2>Legal Information</h2>
                    <p>Please, read the information below BEFORE you submit a loan request.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What is a personal loan?</h3>
                    <p>A personal loan is an unsecured loan you give back in predetermined payments. They are designed to deal with emergencies and unexpected purchases. They shouldn't be viewed or used as a panacea to all problems. If handled poorly, a personal loan may morph into a rather expensive financial solution.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Are personal loans legal?</h3>
                    <p>Personal loans are legal, indeed. However, every state has its own standards and regulation regarding online lending, that's why it's always a good thing to check information with the authorities of your state.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Is Anydaycashusa.com a lender?</h3>
                    <p>No. We are not involved in the lending process, we do not lend money or approve requests and we certainly do not insist or recommend that you borrow them. Our role is simple â€“ to function as a bridge between you, our user, and lenders from our network.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What makes a deal legal?</h3>
                    <p>A loan agreement. This is the very document that makes things real and controlled by law. If one of the parties violates the provisions of the agreement, there will be legal consequences.</p>
                    
                    <h3>When a deal is finalized?</h3>
                    <p>As soon as you e-sign a loan agreement, you can't back away. In this case your e-signature confirms that you've agreed to all the terms, that's why recommend that you think twice before e-signing something.</p>
                </div>
                
                <!-- Disclaimer Tab -->
                <div id="disclaimer" class="tab-content">
                    <h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>

The website functions as a free online platform that establishes a connection between a user and a lender. Lenders on this platform may offer personal loans from $100 to $5000.

                    <h3>Credit Check Notice</h3>
                    <p>You understand that some lenders may check your personal information and review your credit worthiness. They may turn to national databases and credit reporting agencies. Some of these inquiries may affect your credit score. Note that the amount that a lender may offer also depends on local regulations as legislation of some states limits lending terms and conditions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Consumer Notice</h3>
                    <p>Personal loans are loans. They are not designed for dealing with extensive financial difficulties. If handled poorly, they may transform into a rather expensive credit option. If you experience serious budget difficulties, consult credit professionals first. You are under no obligation to use our services.</p>
